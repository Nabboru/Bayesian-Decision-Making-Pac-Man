## Superficial Ghosts: Collective Bayesian Decision-Making in Pacman

## Installation
This project was developed in Python 3.10, hence it is recommended 
(but not required) to use a virtual environment like anaconda. To install anaconda,
check [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

Then create a conda environment with Python 3.10:
```bash
conda create -n pac-man python=3.10
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

## Running

Run the bayesian algorithm:
```
python pacman.py bayesian
```

Run the benchmark algorithm:
```
python pacman.py benchmark
```

Commands:
* ```--n```         Number of runs
* ```--ratio```     Ratio of colours, should be n-1 for n colours
* ```--map```       Name of map
* ```--ghosts```    Number of agents
* ```--colours```   Number of colours

Examples:
Run algorithm 10 times:
```python pacman.py bayesian --n=10```

Run with 5 agents:
```python pacman.py benchmark --ghosts=5```

Run with ratio of 0.6, with white majority:
```python pacman.py bayesian --ratio=0.6```

Run the extended bayesian algorithm in environment with 3 colours with white majority:
```python pacman.py bayesian --ratio=0.6,0.2 --colour=3```

To run the algorithm for ten times with a ratio 0.53 in the line map:
```python pacman.py bayesian --n=10 --ratio=0.53 --map=line ```
